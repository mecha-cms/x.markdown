// The functionality to convert HTML to Markdown does exist in my Markdown converter project, but I am pretty sure that
// it will be used very rarely, so I decided to leave this method blank. There is indeed a feature to convert HTML to
// Markdown in the stand-alone project. You are free to implement that feature for your own purpose(s). However, to
// reduce the file size and the maintenance frequency, I decided to leave this method blank for now.
